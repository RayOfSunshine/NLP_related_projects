## RGCN

This catelogue includes RGCN which is Relational-Graph Convolutional Networks, implemented from the paper Modeling Relational Data with Graph Convolutional Networks. The project focus on link prediction mainly and instead of Keras and TensorFlow1.x, I use TensorFlow 2.x to build the model and go for training. 

Any questions or advises will be warmly welcome.
